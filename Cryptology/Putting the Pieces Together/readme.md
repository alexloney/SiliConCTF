# Putting the Pieces Together

```
Your hacker team was deep inside the empire network and found a highly important encrypted file and a screenshot of the private key used to decrypt the file. How lucky! Unfortunately, when exfiltrating the private key, your team was discovered and had their access cut off. We only got a portion of the key.

Is there anything we can do to decrypt the file?
