# Landing Dock Patrol

```
To sneak Rebels on to the Death Star, we need to know when the dock is going to be unguarded. A successful phishing campagin got us some credentials to the Patrol Scheduling website. Unfortunately, these creds only get us one schedule. We need adminstrative access.

Your our only hope...
