Rebel, we need your help.

Our reconnasiance team have discovered an Empire file sharing server that is exposed to the internet. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is telling me that there is valuable information stored on the server...

Also, the Rebel Red Team has developed a phishing tool that garuntees a Storm Trooper will click on whatever is sent to them. It is here for you if you need it.
