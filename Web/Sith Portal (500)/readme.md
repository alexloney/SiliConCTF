# Sith Portal

```
We have found the login page for the Sith.

If we can get administrative access to this web server, the information we could gain would be invaluable.

Our reconnaissance team was able to get some information that may be of use to you:

1. The email addresses associated with the Sith's accounts use the domain: @galacticempire.com

2. Since there are not many Siths, the length of their email is pretty sort -only 3 characters

    ex: 
    aaa@galacticempire.com


3. Some of the code used to build the web server was recovered. We have attached the zip file.
