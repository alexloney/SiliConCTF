# Deathstar Trench Run

```
We've built a simulation of planned attack on the Empire's new battlestation. Use this to practice before the assault beings.

One thing: The developer forgot to tell us what the coordinates are to hit the vent, and now they're off planet on a mission.

I wonder what happens if the right input is given.

Note: A local copy of the executable has been attached for testing purposes. Please note this executable will only run on Linux systems.
