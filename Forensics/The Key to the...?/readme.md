# The Key to the...?

```
Digging through a scrap pile on Tatooine, one of our scavengars found a discarded Imperial hard drive.

We were only able to recover part of the drive's contents. There appears to be a key in here but it's not clear how to make use of it.

Mind taking a look and seeing what you can find?

Decompress with tar xzf drive.tar.gz
