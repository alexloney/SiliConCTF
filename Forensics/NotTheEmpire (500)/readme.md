# NotTheEmpire

```
We need your help Rebel. We have found some anomalous network traffic in our enviroment. We think that it is some sort of Command and Control Traffic associated with Empire malware.

The network traffic we are seeing is going out to Here.

We think there is something hidden on this site that the malware has been reaching out to.

We also recovered some samples of what we think to be early development versions of the malware. They are stored here
